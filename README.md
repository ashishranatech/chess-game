# ♟️ JavaScript Chess Game by Aashish

A fully functional chessboard built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**, allowing two players to play standard chess with an intuitive UI and real-time turn switching. This is a passion project focused on learning DOM manipulation, visual layout, and basic game logic handcrafted from scratch.

> ⚠️ This project is not using a pre-built chess engine. It’s a fully **manual layout** with custom logic and creativity at its core.
