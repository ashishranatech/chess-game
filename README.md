# ♟️ JavaScript Chess Game by Aashish

A dynamic chessboard built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, allowing two players to engage in a game of chess with an intuitive UI. This is a passion project focused on learning DOM manipulation and implementing game logic from scratch.

> ⚠️ This project is not using a pre-built chess engine. It’s a fully **manual layout** with custom logic and creativity at its core.

This project is currently under development. The primary limitation is:

The king can be captured. The game does not yet implement check, checkmate, or stalemate rules. This is the next major feature I plan to fix and implement.
