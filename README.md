# ♟️ Chess Game by Aashish

A fully functional chess game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project was created from scratch without using any external libraries or chess engines. All logic, movement, and rules are implemented manually, including **legal moves**, **check**, **checkmate**, and **stalemate detection**.

> 🎯 This is a passion project focused on learning algorithmic thinking and advanced DOM manipulation.
